# Resilience

Hey folks,

Today I'd like to talk about resilience.

A big part of our job is handling uncertainty and juggling projects, which can be stressful. In order to be strategic and act as stewards on behalf of our clients and teams, its essential that we find ways to build resilience against anxiety to avoid being subjected to it.

## Resilience

Resilience is not letting clients or events dictate our emotions and out time, it's the ability to accept change gracefully rather than struggle against it. It's partially about perspective and detachment, but there are tools and systems that can help us achieve a degree of resilience regardless of our attitude.

Having seen producers burn out, as well as from my own experience, I've focused on the three stressors that affect us the most:

1. mental strain from multitasking, context switching and notification overload
2. emotional turmoil as a reaction to difficult or unpleasant clients
3. stress from unexpected challenges on projects (often team dynamics)

Today's issue focuses on solutions to protect ourselves against mental fatigue from busyness, multitasking and context switching.

## Overcoming Busyness

Project contracting, client meetings, scheduling and staffing issues, team standups, technical challenges, design conflicts, ticketing boards, overflowing inboxes, constant Slack messages and most importantly - unsolved problems. The average producer day can be a bit of a riot.

Multitasking and context switching are a terrible strain that inevitably produce mediocre decisions and results, mediocre work days. After being subjected to a couple weeks of chaos we enter survival mode and limit our expectations to â€œgetting through the day".

The producer being a central pillar for the team, the project and the client his or her emotional instability affects everyone. A stressed and overwhelmed producer cannot make the best decisions and will not be in a position to foster positive energy in the team - pretty soon any sense of control starts to shatter.

I don't have a perfect handbook as every producer, project and team is different. But I do have a few tips for systems that have proven effective for me:

- **Start your day with the most difficult tasks**: This means blocking out time in your calendar for undistracted focus hours. In the morning your energy and focus levels are at their highest, if you can knock out one or two big tasks in the morning it creates momentum that carries you through the day. It also ensures those tasks get done well, not quickly botched after hours or in between back to back meetings. People will try to book calls with you during focus time, I've found it isn't difficult to reschedule - it's just a matter of prioritisation.
- **Plan less demanding tasks and calls for later**: In the morning or after lunch. We're no longer as productive and focused then anyway: calls are reactive, might as well schedule them when our bodies are in a reactive state.
- **Plan your week before it starts**: On Monday morning take a few minutes set the priority tasks for each morning while leaving some buffer hours for unexpected crises. Once those tasks have been appointed a time, they stop being a constant source of pressure in an endless backlog - one thing less to worry about. This invaluably gives us a sense of control over our day and in my experience significantly reduces anxiety.
- **Don't let Slack and email dictate your day**: Set hours during the day where communication is the priority instead of defaulting to having them open all the time - the constant distraction is nauseating. I also recommend using email clients that amplify productivity and get you to inbox zero, I personally use Superhuman.

The point here is to regain control of our attention to focus on one thing at a time, as much as possible. These systems will probably delay some calls, colleagues and clients may need to wait longer to get an answer from you, but that's a tradeoff I'm willing to make to avoid crappy work and poorly considered decisions.

Another less noticeable consequence is the feeling of pride. Pride in the quality of the work that we're producing and in the solutions we're proposing. Escaping anxiety gives us the time and mental space to be strategic, to be proactive and to be excellent. Rekindling a sense of fulfilment with our work.

Hope you find this helpful!
