I'll put it bluntly: pitching is outdated.

As an industry, we’ve been anchored in the routine of crafting impressive presentations designed to sway potential clients. Presentations aim to sell, to convince, to persuade but in doing so we slip into the presenter/complier role, packaging ourselves into what we believe the client desires without fostering trust, without challenging the brief.

Over the last few years the complexity of web-based projects has increased dramatically and the pitch has been progressively replaced by the Discovery.

This is particularly true in creative production, where projects contain more uncertainty and subjectiveness. Clients need our help producing a combination of emotion, engagement and business results - we cannot fulfil those expectations in a short pitch process, without collaboration and with limited information from an unchallenged brief.

Discoveries remove the need for guesswork and assumptions, instead encouraging conversation and collaboration, understanding and expertise.

In the Alice in Wonderland world of digital production we need to be more than just another vendor - let's be experts, collaborators, co-creators, and partners.

## The Discovery

This brings us to the Discovery. It isn't just a phase, it represents a shift in the way we approach projects. Discoveries aren't about selling; they focus on understanding and trust.

It's about assessing the landscape, understanding the users and their goals, aligning with the client's objectives, recognizing constraints, and identifying unforeseen opportunities. Discoveries are a dedicated phase that allows us to engage in investigation, research, and ideation to refine our ideas within the crucible of reality. They also give us more room for meaningful creativity.

While pitches can be beautiful and engaging, they're often performances that are removed from reality. Discoveries encourage the sharing of ideas and the creation of solutions tailor-made for specific needs. We can use them to redefine the relationship we have with our clients and the work that we do - beautiful and effective.

## Discovery 101

These are the focal points for your Discovery.

- **Competitor Analysis**: Understanding where your client stands in the market in comparison to your competitors.
- **Strategy Analysis**: Assessing ther business strategy and determining how it aligns with the project's goals.
- **Pain Point Analysis**: Identifying the challenges and problems you're looking to solve with this project.
- **Audience & Context Analysis**: Understanding who the audience is, their needs, and the context in which they'll be interacting with the end product.
- **Data Analysis**: Examining any available data that can provide insight into the project, or the data that will need to be communicated.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Outlining the path your users will take, from the first point of contact to the ultimate goal.
- **Concept Design**: Exploring and defining the visual and functional aspects of the project.
- **Prototyping**: Building a preliminary version of your project to test ideas and assumptions.

These areas form the basis of our Discovery phase. They provide the structure and focus needed to ensure our investigation and ideation are both targeted and effective. They inform the production that follows.

I’ll be dedicating an entire chapter to Discoveries in the upcoming course, for now here's a preview of some of the questions I use during the workshops.

### Project Specifics

- Why embark on this project now?
- What are your goals for this project? How will we define and measure success?
- Conversely, what would indicate a failure?
- What is the consequence of doing nothing?
- What's your timeline? Are there intermediate deadlines to consider?
- Who will be the final decision maker? How and when is this person involved?

### Knowing Your Audience

- Who are we targeting with this project?
- Can we encapsulate your audience in a few descriptive words?
- What needs and frustrations does your audience have?
- What's their interest level in the project's topic?
- What's their likely attention span when interacting with the end product?

The thoughts contained in this issue are largely inspired by Blair Enns' 'Win Without Pitching Manifesto' which I highly recommend to anyone interested in escaping the pitch to sell differently.

As we escape the vendor trap and position ourselves as experts, our relationships with clients become more trusting and benevolent, the challenges we overcome more varied and stimulating, the results of our work more impactful to their businesses.

I hope you’ll be pitching less in 2023!

Best of luck.
